<ul>
  <li><strong>Story 1:</strong> As a domestic worker who cannot read English well, I want to watch an educational video in my own language so that I can understand what's in my job contract before signing it.</li>
  <li><strong>Story 2:</strong> As a worker with no internet at home, I want to download videos and use WhatsApp offline so that I can still access helpful information about my rights.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1–5 Year Vision: Evolution of the Prototype</h2>

<h3>Year 1 - Core Video Development & Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create 3–5 short, illustrated videos explaining the basics of a job contract (e.g., hours, pay, leave, termination)</li>
  <li>Translate videos into multiple local languages and share via WhatsApp links and YouTube</li>
  <li>Test videos alongside the chatbot in the same test area, with group screenings and feedback sessions</li>
  <li>Partner with community media producers and legal aid organizations for script accuracy and cultural relevance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 2 - Expanded Topics & Offline Access</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add new videos covering advanced topics: unfair dismissal, deductions, workplace safety, and dispute resolution</li>
  <li>Adapt content into audio-only versions for radio or WhatsApp voice notes</li>
  <li>Distribute content offline via DVDs, USBs, and local screening events in community centers and churches</li>
  <li>Collaborate with community radio stations for educational broadcasts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 3 - Interactive Video & Certification</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create interactive, "choose-your-response" video stories (e.g., negotiating for leave or overtime)</li>
  <li>Develop a short video-based training series that NGOs can use for workshops or induction</li>
  <li>Seek certification or endorsement from labour bodies like the Department of Labour or CCMA for formal use in employment orientation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 4 - Public Distribution Partnerships</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Secure partnerships with major platforms (e.g., YouTube for Nonprofits, Meta) to promote video content widely</li>
  <li>Include the videos as part of employment orientation for agencies that place domestic workers</li>
  <li>Begin co-producing testimonial videos featuring real domestic workers sharing positive contract experiences</li>
</ul>

<h3>Year 5 - National Reach & Curriculum Integration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Distribute videos nationwide via labour offices, community centers, schools, and mobile info vans</li>
  <li>Integrate content into adult education or vocational training programs</li>
  <li>Develop a toolkit for employers that includes the videos to promote ethical practices</li>
  <li>Continuously update videos based on legal changes and user feedback</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anticipated Risks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited Access to Data and Devices:</strong> Watching videos requires data and compatible devices, which not all domestic workers possess</li>
  <li><strong>Low Engagement Due to Format:</strong> If videos are too long, overly formal, or poorly localized, users may lose interest or fail to relate to the content</li>
  <li><strong>Information Misinterpretation:</strong> Without context or guidance, some workers might misinterpret legal content or take incorrect actions</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Ongoing Funding:</strong> Video production requires time, scriptwriting, editing, and translation, ongoing funding is needed to maintain quality and relevance</li>
  <li><strong>Distribution Gaps:</strong> Even well-made videos are ineffective if not distributed through the right channels (e.g., offline communities, WhatsApp groups, training centers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Partnerships</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Community Media Outlets (e.g., radio/TV stations):</strong> Airing content widely and regularly to reach broader audiences</li>
  <li><strong>Legal and Labour Rights Experts (e.g., ILO, ProBono.org, Black Sash):</strong> Ensuring script accuracy, legal compliance, and credibility</li>
  <li><strong>Video Production Studios / University Media Units:</strong> Affordable, high-quality, and culturally appropriate video production</li>
  <li><strong>Digital Platforms (e.g., YouTube for Nonprofits):</strong> Expanding reach with cost-effective ad promotions and distribution</li>
  <li><strong>NGOs, Faith-Based Groups, Training Centers:</strong> Distributing videos through workshops, gatherings, shelters, and meetings, especially in low-digital-access areas</li>
</ul>
